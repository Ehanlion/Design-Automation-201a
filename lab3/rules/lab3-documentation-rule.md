# Lab 3: Documentation rule

Do NOT willy nilly generate docs, I don't need them

ALL documents must be generated in the lab3/documentation/ directory please!

ALL documents must be in markdown formatting.

I only need dosc to explain ther solutions for the lab 3 part 1 and part 2. 

Part 1 asks:
 In the report, describe your algorithm for computing total HPWL in words and include the total HPWL for the
desi and to Justify your assumptions as necessary

This doc file shoud just give this information and nothing more.

Part 2 asks:
In the report, describe your algorithm and your approach, your HPWL after incremental placement, the number of
swaps it took to achieve this, and the total execution time for your program.

This doc file shoudl jsut give this information and nothing more.
