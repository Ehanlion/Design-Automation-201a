The following primary inputs have no external driver or input transition set .  
As a result the transition on the ports will be assumed as zero. The            
'external_driver' attribute is used to add and external driver or the           
'fixed_slew' attribute to add an external transition.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.

'external_driver' attribute is used to add and external driver or the           
'fixed_slew' attribute to add an external transition.

Inputs without external driver/transition

The following primary inputs have no external driver or input transition set .  
As a result the transition on the ports will be assumed as zero. The            
'external_driver' attribute is used to add and external driver or the           
'fixed_slew' attribute to add an external transition.
