**WARN: (IMPEXT-3518):	The lower process node is set (using command 'setDesignMode') but the technology file for TQuantus extraction not specified. Therefore, going for postRoute (effortLevel low) extraction instead of recommended extractor 'TQuantus' for lower nodes. Use command 'set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner' to specify the technology file for TQuantus extraction to take place.
Extraction called for design 's1494_bench' of instances=314 and nets=332 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .

**WARN: (IMPEXT-3493):	The design extraction status has been reset by set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner or setExtractRCMode  command. The parasitic data can be regenerated either by extracting the design using the extractRC command or by loading the SPEF or RCDB file(s). To prevent resetting of the extraction status, avoid changing extraction modes.
Type 'man IMPEXT-3493' for more detail.

**WARN: (IMPEXT-3518):	The lower process node is set (using command 'setDesignMode') but the technology file for TQuantus extraction not specified. Therefore, going for postRoute (effortLevel low) extraction instead of recommended extractor 'TQuantus' for lower nodes. Use command 'set_analysis_view/update_rc_corner' to specify the technology file for TQuantus extraction to take place.
Extraction called for design 's1494_bench' of instances=314 and nets=332 using extraction engine 'postRoute' at effort level 'low' .
PostRoute (effortLevel low) RC Extraction called for design s1494_bench.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
Type 'man IMPEXT-6197' for more detail.

so it should only be saved when it is really desired.
