# Lab 3: Testing Rule

Make sure to always test code. Linting errors are not acceptable. Errors in compilation are not acceptable. Code is not complete until it can be run with no errors. If I cannot execute the run script for the code and it fully cleans, compiles, and runs the code for that specific cpp file, then it is not complete. These are required.

Put all scripting for running the file in scripts/ directory for lab 3. If you are running console commands to test and run things, make sure you ALSO test by just runnign teh script to ensure it cleans, compiles, and runs the code without fault or error.
