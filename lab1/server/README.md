# Plotting Server

This directory contains HTML plots generated by the lab1_test program and a simple HTTP server to preview them.

## Files

- `server.py` - Python HTTP server script
- `server.sh` - Server management script (start/stop/restart)
- `fanout_histogram.html` - Generated fanout histogram (created by lab1_test)

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
cd plotting
./server.sh start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`

### Viewing Plots

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to:
- Fanout Histogram: `http://localhost:8000/fanout_histogram.html`

**Note:** If you're SSH'd into a remote server, you'll need to set up port forwarding:
```bash
# In your local terminal:
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 palatics@eeapps02
```

### Server Commands

```bash
./server.sh start    # Start the server
./server.sh stop     # Stop the server
./server.sh restart  # Restart the server (useful after regenerating HTML)
./server.sh refresh  # Same as restart
./server.sh status   # Check if server is running
```

### Regenerating Plots

1. Run your lab1_test program:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   source lab1_setup
   ./lab1_test
   ```

2. Refresh the server (if it's already running):
   ```bash
   cd plotting
   ./server.sh refresh
   ```

3. Reload the page in your browser (Ctrl+R or F5)
