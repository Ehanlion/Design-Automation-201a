The following primary inputs have no external driver or input transition set .  
As a result the transition on the ports will be assumed as zero. The            
'external_driver' attribute is used to add and external driver or the           
'fixed_slew' attribute to add an external transition.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.

Timing exceptions with no effect

The following timing exceptions are not currently affecting timing in the       
design.  Either no paths in the design satisfy the exception's path             
specification, or all paths that satisfy the path specification also satisfy an 
exception with a higher priority.  You can improve runtime and memory usage by  
removing these exceptions if they are not truly needed.  To see if there is a   
path in the design that satisfies the path specification for an exception, or   
to see what other exception is overriding an exception because of priority, use 
the command:

Timing exceptions with no effect

The following timing exceptions are not currently affecting timing in the       
design.  Either no paths in the design satisfy the exception's path             
specification, or all paths that satisfy the path specification also satisfy an 
exception with a higher priority.  You can improve runtime and memory usage by  
removing these exceptions if they are not truly needed.  To see if there is a   
path in the design that satisfies the path specification for an exception, or   
to see what other exception is overriding an exception because of priority, use 
the command:

Inputs without external driver/transition

The following primary inputs have no external driver or input transition set .  
As a result the transition on the ports will be assumed as zero. The            
'external_driver' attribute is used to add and external driver or the           
'fixed_slew' attribute to add an external transition.

Outputs without external load

The following primary outputs have no external load set . As a result the load  
on the ports will be assumed as zero. The 'external_pin_cap' attribute is used  
to add and external pin cap.
